I have finally decided to put some of my personnal projects ideas as open-source projects.

<ul>
<li>jdbc-logger  (Jdbc performance J2EE profiler)</li>
<li>sef4j : Simple Event Facade For Java  (java applicative instrumentation for profiler)</li>
<li>jxmvc : eXtensive MVC with field dependency propagation (Excel like dependency function, in a Transactional model code)</li>
<li>mda4j : Model Driven Architecture for Java (reflection framework for client-server DTO transfer with rich behavior)</li>
<li>cmdb4j : Configuration Management Database for Java (mainly for applicative parameters per environement, then deployment and Monitoring)</li>
<li>java code analysis, eclipse plugins tools</li>
<li>image and sound analysis</li>
<li>...other</li>
</ul>


Here is a short description of the aims and motivation behinds.

 
Basically, I found problems to solve at office. These are day to day developper problems and tools or framework I whish I could use if they existed.
Within the office context, these problems are sometimes too specific, less interresting that at home, because of proprietary and legacy code around, and lack of isolation. So I code them at home, with less constraints.

2 possibilities:
<ul>
<li> I start coding a specific program solution at work, and then think about re-implementing it at home, differently, trying to do it more elegantly and more generically. </li>
<li> Some other times, it helps me coding restfully at home first, and then reimporting a simpler more pragmatic solution at work, when all technical points are solved in my mind.</li>
</ul>

Unfortunatly, coding Open Source directly from my office is not legally possible... Things changes but I have to wait more.


Of course, problems at work always finish as solutions, or are replaced by other new problems, and my motivation disapears in a solved-problem or forgotten-one!
Putting these projects on github is first of all a way to give them to whoever wants to see them, use them, or improve them.

See next posts for a description of these projects...
